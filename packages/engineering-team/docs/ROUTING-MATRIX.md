# Routing Matrix

The table describes native platform routing. Local `ai-team` uses fixed isolated plan/implement/validate/review stages rather than dynamic Dot/model routing; see [stage assignments](ISOLATED-AGENT-STAGES.md) and [local workflow](LOCAL-LINUX-WORKFLOW.md). Specialist skills are still selected according to task need.

| Work | Default surface | Escalate when |
|---|---|---|
| Persistent coordination, portfolio triage, proactive follow-up | Engineering Dot | repository mutation is needed |
| Code/change/test/review in repository | Codex | external business-system action or deep artifact research dominates |
| Deep research, reports, documents, spreadsheets, presentations | ChatGPT Work | code execution becomes primary |
| Narrow external system read/write | Plugin | task becomes multi-step engineering/research |
| High-risk production/destructive action | Human approval + native controls | never bypass |

Routing goals: minimum privilege, minimum context, clear evidence ownership and proportional cost. A Dot may coordinate Codex/Work; their usage/budgets remain separately observable and must not be assumed free.
