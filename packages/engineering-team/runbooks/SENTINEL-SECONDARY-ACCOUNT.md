# Sentinel — Secondary Account Setup

## Local Linux

Use `ai-team login sentinel` after [installation](../docs/LOCAL-LINUX-WORKFLOW.md), with a distinct OpenAI account from Atlas, then `ai-team doctor`. This configures the read-only reviewer CLI volume; it does not instantiate a Sentinel Dot.

## Native Dot setup

1. Sign into the secondary eligible OpenAI account and create/name the Dot Sentinel.
2. Apply templates/SENTINEL-BOOTSTRAP.md plus applicable Custom Rules.
3. Connect GitHub with read/review minimum privilege where available.
4. Do not grant production write.
5. Register only projects Sentinel is allowed to review.
6. Ask Sentinel to read the architecture, authority, disagreement and result contracts.
7. First fixture must contain a deliberate blocking defect; verify Sentinel does not PASS it.
8. Review an Atlas request pinned to a head SHA.
9. Change the PR after review; verify prior verdict is not reused for the new SHA.
10. Preserve result/evidence and feed it back to Atlas through the shared repository/PR workflow.

Do not broaden permissions merely to make a scenario pass.
