# Atlas — Primary Account Setup

## Local Linux

Use `ai-team login atlas` after [installation](../docs/LOCAL-LINUX-WORKFLOW.md), then `ai-team doctor`. This configures a Codex CLI volume, not a Dot. Confirm Atlas/Sentinel accounts are distinct.

## Native Dot setup

1. Create the primary Dot and name it Atlas.
2. Apply templates/ATLAS-BOOTSTRAP.md plus applicable DOT-CUSTOM-RULES.
3. Connect GitHub/Codex with only approved repositories.
4. Register ai-engineering-team first.
5. Confirm repository writes use branch/PR by default.
6. Confirm production/destructive actions remain R3 and require explicit/native approval.
7. Ask Atlas to read ATLAS-SENTINEL-ARCHITECTURE and authority policy.
8. Run a read-only task, then a reversible repository task.
9. Require Atlas to emit a review request for an R2 fixture.
10. Preserve evidence under validation/runs.

Do not mark Atlas operationally validated until the live scenarios pass.
