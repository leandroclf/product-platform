# Security policy

## Supported versions

OmniCLI is alpha software. Security fixes are applied to the latest release and the `main` branch; older versions may not receive patches.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability. Use the repository's [private security advisory form](https://github.com/leandroclf/OmniCLI/security/advisories/new) and include:

- affected version or commit;
- impact and realistic attack scenario;
- minimal reproduction steps;
- suggested mitigation, if known.

Do not include real secrets or personal data. Maintainers should acknowledge a complete report within seven days and coordinate disclosure after a fix or documented mitigation is available.

## Security posture

OmniCLI does not provide a sandbox. Provider CLIs run with the current user's
permissions and may send content to external services. The default provider
environment is restricted, input content is hash-only by default, manifests are
atomic and redacted, and execution is bounded by time, output, step, and call
limits. These controls reduce risk but do not replace OS isolation or provider
privacy review.

The project does not execute generated code or mutate repositories in the
current conception workflow. Review the [production readiness](docs/production-readiness.md)
and [threat model](docs/threat-model.md) for boundaries and residual risks.
